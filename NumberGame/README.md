# Overview

This week I started to learn Java and created a Number Guessing game in it. I wanted to familiarize myself with the object oriented programming of Java and it's unique syntax. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and the user will input their guess to compare. The main class is NumberGame, then the other classes are Number and HighScores. NumberGame manages the game loop. Number creates the value and checks against the guess. HighScore reads and writes to a file. 

This is my first Java project and I wanted to create something that I could build on. I wanted it to be simple enough that I could start small, and add onto it as I learned more.

# Development Environment

Developed in Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA using Java. I used various online resources, in the useful websites section.
Various libraries imported from java.util and java.io were used such as Scanner, Random, File, and IOException.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Fix file reading method.
- Add a GUI.
- Update to a more detailed high score list of top 10 scores and users.
