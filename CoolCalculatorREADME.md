# Overview

This is my first C++ program. I started this program to learn the C++ language and become more familiar with it since it is one of the widest used languages. I found it to be quite a challenge and so I have much to learn still as I continue to expand on this simple calculator. I hope through my program that I can become more familiar and further my learning of C++.

This software is the beginning stages of a C++ calculator using a GUI. It uses 6 operators that can be used, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents. For the GUI I accomplished creating the screen. Starting and learning C++ was undeniably the hardest part for me making this program as there are so many differences from the languages I am more familiar with. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
